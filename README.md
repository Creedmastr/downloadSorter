# Informations
This app is coded in Python 3.10.2 and develloped by me.
It is used to sort everything contained in the downloaded folder.
Works in Windows 10, and Windows 11 if  Onedrive is not used (a version for OneDrive should come soon)

# Installation
To install it, you just need to download the python script and run it on your machine.
You can also use the exe file, if you want to.
